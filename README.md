# waterpumps

This data comes from Taarifa's dashboards which aggregate data from the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. It was made available so that citizens can stay engaged with the local government and hold them accountable. The dataset includes 40 features from almost 75,000 water pumps across the country. Examples of some of the features include geographic location of waterpumps, water quality and quantity measures, the companies that install, fund and maintain the pumps, and whether communities are paying for the water.

The government's goal is to provide clean water to communities across the country. By understanding which pumps might fail, they can improve maintenance and operations. 

I've included the original train and test datasets, the train labels, the code I used to cleanup the datasets and the code I used to predict waterpump functionality.
